<ol>
<li>This is a series of challenging puzzles, each with a short answer. Sometimes it is a single word, sometimes a string of letters or numbers. Sometimes it can be more than one word.</li>
<li>Remove any spaces from answers and remove any capitalisation (answers in lowercase only).</li>
<li>It will usually be obvious when you have the right answer so don't spend ages guessing.</li>
<li>If you are stuck on one puzzle for a long time try and think about it in different ways or have a break and come back to it later.</li>
<li>When you have the answer replace the part of the URL before .html with it, like this: http://www.mcgov.co.uk/riddles/<strong>youranswer</strong>.html</li>
<li>Most of the clues do not require the use of a search engine to complete. You will be given a hint to use one where it is required.</li>
<li>If you are discussing these riddles in public forums do not give answers directly. Clues and hints are fine.</li>
<li>The level number is always in the top left corner.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you're ready to start, off you go...</p>
